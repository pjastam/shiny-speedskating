### Quick summary
This app is derived from the original `shiny-speedskating` app for the purpose of comparing speed skaters at the [2018 Olympic Games](https://www.olympic.org/pyeongchang-2018).

### Version
1.0

### Motivation
This app compares the best monthly track times of speed skaters whose names are at the [Men's 1000m Entry List](https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/game-time/results/OWG2018/en/speed-skating/entries-by-event-men-s-1000m.htm). As the purpose is simply to identify which speed skaters have the potential to win their race, the graphed paths are unadjusted for the difference in dates of birth by default.
